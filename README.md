🏠 House Sales Prediction Using ML
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning models.
It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

⚙️ Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Multiple ML models tested (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Model performance evaluation with accuracy metrics

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains details about houses (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location).

Target variable: House Sale Price

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
